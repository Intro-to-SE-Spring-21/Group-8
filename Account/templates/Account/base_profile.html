    This is where the base layout of how our profile page will look will go.

    Start by basically copying all the code from the base.html file in Main_page/templates/, and then we want to 
    replace the tweets section with a profile section (see issue on github)

<html lang="en">
<head>

    <title>{{user.first_name}} {{user.last_name}} (@{{user.username}})</title>
</head>
<body>
    
    {% block home_page %}

    {% endblock %}
